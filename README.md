# Welcome to Sourcer package manager
### A package manager made for managing your Bash projects.

Sourcer is a npmlike package manager for your Bash projects. It allows you to add dependencies to your .bash/.sh project. I know, there are some other attempts which are doing the same thing, but those attempts are kind of some Git CLI frontends where you type basher clone basher/basher and it will clone the repo. Sourcer goes on it diiferently. It has its own centralized repo, [repo-main](https://github.com/Sourcer-bash-package-manager/repo-main) and you can fork the repo and make your own.
